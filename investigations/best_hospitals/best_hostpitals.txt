The methodology for this question was to find the top ten scores for effective care as well as readmission by finding a weighted average of the scores from the effective_care_tr table and the readmissions_tr table. The idea is that effective_care is much more important and frequently relied on stat compared to readmissions, which happens less regularly, so the weights are placed at 6:4.
